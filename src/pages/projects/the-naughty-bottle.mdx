## Explanation

The Naughty Bottle was a first term project in my (on going) Computer Science course in Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana.
It was made in a team: I made the front-end, the design and integration with some JS libraries, and my colleague made all the back-end implementation, database modelling and creation.

## Theme

The ideia behind this project was to work with e-commerce systems and stock managment, and we choose as the theme a fictcious store that sells
weird, magical and suspicious products (with many references to RPG games, ofc).

This project contains 3D assets (credits in the project), advanced SVG | CSS animations and it can be a bit slow due to its poor 3D implementation (my fault!), but we had a short time window to finish such a bold project, but what can I say? it was worth it.
