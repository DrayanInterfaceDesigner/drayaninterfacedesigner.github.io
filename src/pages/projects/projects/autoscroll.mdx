## Explanation

Autoscroll.js is a free and veeeeery simple alternative to paid libraries that handles auto-scrolling. At the time I've made it, autoscrolling was a thing and most libraries that could do this simple effect were paid or didn't work properly, plus, the "scroll-behavior" css property was a new feature and had serious supportability problems. 

Nowadays, there are many other libraries that you can (and should) use if you want this kind of functionality/effect. But if you just want to make a simple page or small website, Autoscroll.js can do the job.
