## Explanation

NoMoreAdd is an simple util app for desktop that allows you to talk with people in whatsapp without having to add them.

It had three versions: Browser version, Console version and finally, a Desktop (Windows) version.
The version shown in the image above is the desktop version, and probably the last one since the motivation for making it
is no longer an issue.

## Motivation

During the most restrict phase of the pandemic, everyone was working from home and I, needing to add every single client and/or friend that I made on Discord to just be able to talking with them was getting pissed off, so I decided it was the time to act!

<b> So I put on my gloves, tightened up my shoes and started to code. </b>

The ideia was to create an app that could run whatsapp already on the chat I wanted with just one click. Surprisingly, it was so useful that I decided to make a desktop C# version ans stuck with it for more than a year.
