## Explanation

NoMoreAdd is a simple util app for desktop, that allows you to talk with people in whatsapp without having to add them.

It have three versions: Browser version, Console version and finally, a Desktop (Windows) version.

The version shown in the image above is the desktop one, and probably the last since the motivation for making it
is no longer here.

## Motivation

During the most restrict phase of the pandemic, everyone was working from home, and I, needing to add every single client and/or friend that I made online just to be able to talking with them, was getting pissed off. So I decided that it was the time to act!

<strong> So I put on my gloves, tightened up my shoes and started to code. </strong>

The ideia was to create an app that could launch whatsapp already in the chat I wanted with just one click. Surprisingly, it ended being so useful that I decided to make a desktop C# version, and stucked with it for more than a year.
