## Explanation

An old project, was one of the first times I decided to do something more complex than a button, and started to get interested in game development. Therefore, it's an important milestone
in my developer's life and I found the idea interesting enough to be posted.

Ps: the publishing on GitHub is recent, but the code is old.
