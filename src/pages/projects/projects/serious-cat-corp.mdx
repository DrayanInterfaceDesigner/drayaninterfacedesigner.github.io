## Explanation

Oh... Serious Cat Corp., the things I would do for you...

SCC, besides its very serious nature, it's a simple game project, with a simple character selection mechanism, and supposed to have mobs, a player and interactables (so it would actually
be considered a game). But due to the motivation for making it, will remain incomplete.

## Motivation

This project is my darling, my light. Initially, it was created to teach programming to a friend of mine, and had several versions. 
I wanted to teach her from the basics to the intermediary, the usage of tools, vanilla JS, vanilla CSS, HTML, frameworks like React, everything related to web development.

I consider it finilized because I don't think I'll ever touch on it again, at least for a long time. I would need to rewrite the react-not-react code, since it doesn't
use components at all (I wanted first to teach the core in a simple way, without components). 

Despite all the mess this project is, I love it, and I think it's beautiful enough to be here. The design, lessons, illustrations, and code were all made from scratch by me, and are included in this project's repo.

It's also good to mention that this project is really old and can have some problems running on newer versions of react.
