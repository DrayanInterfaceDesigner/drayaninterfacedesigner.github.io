## Explanation

Alona is a JavaScript Engine to simulate complex physics performantly, and with ease of use. It is a new project so still in its humble begnnings, with some bugs and features, but you can try it yourself already if you want to (check the links below).

Alona is being made using TypeScript, Three.js and lots of math, and I'll probably use some physics libraries for some simulations that won't affect the core principles of the engine.

## Foundations

The ideia is to divide it into 4 parts: Particles, Relations, Spaces and Forces.

Particles represents an individual point with mass in space. It can be literally a vector with no appearence or significant size, to a fully grown bear, with big claws and a cute hat. Basically anything with mass and position.

Relations are the relations between particles, they glues them together and tell them how to affect its surroundings and each other. It is important to notice that relations will not directly affect the related particles, they will tell the particles how to act together when a force is applied.
Also, a particle always have a relation with it's space, so one or a group of particles can affect the space itself, the,efore, affecting other particles.

Spaces are a fluid stage in which the particles play an act, it can be manipulated to achieve different conditions, from gravity to umidity, friction, universal constants and more (maybe quantum physics when the time to move the engine to WebAssembly comes).

And finally, the forces. The forces are manipulations in state/position matrices and "inner particles" (this engine is being made with low fidelity simulations of atoms and elemental particles in mind). The ideia here is to be able to represent complex forces or influences with ease and speed, in exchange of precision.

With all that said, unfortunately I don't think I'll be focusing on Alona that much in the next few months (I'm writting it in 2023/05/13), so you can consider it paused on its current version (SprottLinzD 1.3.0-alpha). This version don't have much in it, I was messing around with Three, pipelines and different approachs for rendering before actually doing physics, BUT it has some gorgeous chaotic attractors for you to play with.

## Motivation

My motivation to make this project was basically my frustation when I tried to make some chaotic attractors and fluid simulations but couldn't find anything actually perfomant or good in JS. I wanted to make actual simulations, in an environment with a big scope of variables.

## And... why Javascript again?

Okay, okay, I know what you're probably thinking. JS isn't perfomant, it's buggy, clunky and problematic. Oh and how could I forget? it have this "little-big" problem of being single threaded.

To argue against all this, all I can offer is a hug and some basic statements. First of all, JS can compete with Python regarding performance in some scenerios, as you can see in [this benchmark (Python VS Javascript benchmarks, 2023)](https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/python-vs-javascript). Second, you can achieve some sord of multithreading with some neat tricks(). And finally, I have some V8 (chromium JS engine) publications that I stole from SimonDev(SimonDev, 2021) about speed, memory (V8, 2020) and performance (V8, 2010). I recommend you to check those out, and you can find them in the refereces bellow.
