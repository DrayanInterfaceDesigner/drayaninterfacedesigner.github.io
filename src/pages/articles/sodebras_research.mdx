## 3D RECONSTRUCTION BASED ON PHOTOGRAMMETRY FOR MIXED REALITY IN INTERACTIVE SIMULATION VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS
Abstract â€“ This paper will study software, libraries, and devices options for 3D reconstruction based on photogrammetry, and development of a prototype for realistic interactive virtual environment simulations. In this, I will define quality evaluation criteria for the chosen software for the aforementioned topics. Finally, I will present an application prototype targeting Mircrosoft HoleLens 2, built using the tools judged adequate for the purpose in this research.
