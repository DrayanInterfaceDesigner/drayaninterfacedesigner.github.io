I have always been passionate about knowledge and extremely curious
about beauty and how the world's mechanisms work, so at the age 
of twelve, I decided to start learning Design and a good bit of physics
and programming - at the time in AS3, which greatly escalated into 
my main passions in life.

For a large part of my life, Design took the place in my heart, so
after ten years studying it by myself. I became a freelancer for two years , and started a bachelor in Design at my current university.

Four years ago, I discovered the wonders of programming (with
real programming languages) and suddenly what was a hobbie turned into my full time devotion. 
It quickly surpassed my passion for design, and I wholeheartedly embraced it.

Now, in 2023, I'm studying Computer Science at Pontíficia Universidade 
Católica do Paraná and working on a research with Dr. Marcelo Rudek, PhD, 
MSc, Postdoc and Prof - under his supervision, regarding mixed reality
and realistic virtual simulations.

In my spare time I'm also developing a Physics Engine for web that is
in its early stages.
